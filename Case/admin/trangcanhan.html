                Sport keeps us fit. Keeps you mindful. Brings us together. Through

                moving. Sportswear featuring the latest technologies, to up your
                performance. Beat your PB.adidas offers a home to the runner, the
                basketball player, the soccer kid, the fitness enthusiast. The
                weekend hiker that loves to escape the city. The yoga teacher that
                spreads the moves. The 3-Stripes are seen in the music scene. On
                stage, at festivals. Our sports clothing keeps you focused before
                that whistle blows. During the race. And at the finish lines.

                And change the world. adidas is about more than sportswear and
                workout clothes. We partner with the best in the industry to

              <h2>Workout clothes, for any sport</h2>
              <div>
                adidas designs for and with athletes of all kinds. Creators, who
                love to change the game. Challenge conventions. Break the rules
                and define new ones. Then break them again. We supply teams and
                individuals with athletic clothing pre-match. To stay focussed. We
                design sports apparel that get you to the finish line. To win the
                match. We support women, with bras and tights made for purpose.
                From low to high support. Maximum comfort. We design, innovate and
                itterate. Testing new technologies in action. On the pitch, the
                tracks, the court, the pool. Retro workout clothes inspire new
                streetwear essentials. Like NMD, Ozweego and our Firebird
                tracksuits. Classic sports models are brought back to life. Like
                Stan Smith. And Superstar. Now seen on the streets and the stages.
                Through our collections we blur the borders between high fashion
                and high performance. Like our adidas by Stella McCartney athletic
                clothing collection – designed to look the part inside and outside
                of the gym. Or some of our adidas Originals lifestyle pieces, that
                can be worn as sportswear too. Our lives are constantly changing.
                Becoming more and more versatile. And adidas designs with that in
                mind.
